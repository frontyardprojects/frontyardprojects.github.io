### Getaroom @ Frontyard

You have a provocation to explore. A project to begin. A local problem to solve. A team of pro-active people to assemble. We have the space and a network of people to connect you with.

Frontyard is a space for research, imagining, problem-solving, doing & not doing, meeting, talking, and making time. There are 2 short-term (1-2 weeks) residency spaces for artists and non-artists, and an open door policy for hosting people in our workshop, garden and library if your project needs a place to grow after your residency ends.

In return for the space and time to think, Frontyard asks for a small gift of time from each resident. That could mean participating as a provocateur in a futuring session, giving a public talk, sharing skills via a workshop, symposium, film night, performance, or something else you think is important for the community.

**Practical Stuff:**

In each #getaroom:
- table, chair, shelves, working wall
- Access Hours - round the clock
- Public Access and Programs - Thursday to Sunday and Thursday night
- Internet - yes
- Sleeping over - no! (but if you are from out of town, we can help find you a bed)
- Other assets - workshop area, small kitchen, kitchen garden, library, hammocks, pro-active people!

How do I #getaroom?
We have a 'no application' policy, so as long as you are happy to sign our MoU and we can find a time slot that suits, you're in! We prefer to meet you face to face first, unless you are too far away to drop in. Come along to our monthly *Open House* (see [our calendar](/events/) to find the nexy Open House) or drop us an email to make time for a cuppa.

What we ask from you.
- fill out our Google form so we have your contact details, and sign our MoU
- book an induction with us via email or #slack 1 week before your residency starts
- send us 1-2 sentences about what you'll be working and an image, so we can put it on our website and Insta
- Upload images and text you want to share to our Flickr archive when you're in residence
- Tell us when and what you want to do as a 'gift of time' for the Frontyard community - you don't need to know before you start so no rush!
