#### \* TANDEM: A LANGUAGE EXCHANGE CLUB \*
Tandem, or language exchanges, are a relaxed and effective way to learn or improve a language. Two (or more) people who speak different languages meet to practice each other’s language. The desired language is spoken by your ‘tandem’ partner. This means that both languages can be spoken and practiced in a language exchange.
For this to work, we need to build up a pool of language learners, who will be matched with language partners.
We are currently working on a Tandem Partner Pool, please contact us: [info@frontyardprojects.org](info@frontyardprojects.org), contact Julia Bavyka

#### \* YOUR IDEA \*
If you want to organise something and invite others to be involved, drop in and have a chat. We will add it here.
Organised by: *You*
