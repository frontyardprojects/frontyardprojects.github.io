### Get involved:

\*\*Frontyard\*\* aims to be an open and safe space - if you would like to host an event at frontyard please get in touch either via [email](mailto:frontyardprojects@gmail.com) or by coming along to one of our regular open house events. We have a simple application by conversation policy. **The space is free for unfunded and not-for-profit projects**, for everything else we have a standard rate sheet which applies. \*\*Frontyard\*\* is made possible by the [generous support of our community](/supporters).
