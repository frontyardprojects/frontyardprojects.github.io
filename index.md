Frontyard is open for events and by appointment, plus last Sunday of each month 1-3pm for open house, or when listed by the librarians.

A Not-Only-Artist Run Initiative. A pro-active, flexible space for practical skills-sharing, community cultural engagement and critical research. Our aim is to challenge, facilitate and nurture collaborations between people with a passion for culture and to build a more resilient and sustainable independent arts community for the future.
